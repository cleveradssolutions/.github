# Welcome to CAS.AI

The CAS.AI Mobile Ads SDK (by CleverAdsSolutions) offers advanced mobile advertising capabilities with refined ad formats and streamlined APIs to access multiple ad networks and maximize monetization in mobile apps.

CAS.AI supports 25+ mediation adapters, giving you the flexibility to include only the networks you want in your application. All other tasks including registering your app with third-party services, configuring ad units, and preparing your mediation stack are handled automatically by our platform. You don’t need to manually create accounts or set up placements across multiple ad networks. We do it for every app individually, ensuring a smooth, optimized, and headache-free onboarding experience.
